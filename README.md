# This is the Vertices path generator

Use the buttons to add different trajectories, and drag around their start, end, and control points to achieve the desired path. You can then use the generated code inside your vertices opmode!

Use it at https://verticespathgen.vercel.app, in the chrome browser. Alternatively, you can download the desktop app from the releases page or build it locally with the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run make
```
The installer for your platform will be in the out directory. Read more about the packaging in the [electron forge website](https://www.electronforge.io).
